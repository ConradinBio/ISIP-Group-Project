ToDo:
----------------

1. normalize the brightness of the pictures - DONE
2. detect the center of the spiral (what exactly is the spiral? (is it the one leading us into depression?))
3. detect each electrode contact
  - they are equally spaced (prediction of invisible contacts is thus possible)
  - innermost is contact 1, outermost contact 12
4. compute angular insertion depth (in degrees)


----------------
Concrete steps:
----------------

1.
  - cropping to get rid the watermark - DONE (first 23 rows cropped)
  - brightness adjusted - DONE
2.
  - detect edges in preop pic  - wip
  - detect 3 levels (bone, fluid, air) and maybe merge air and bone
3.
  - import each postop pic
  - count the number of found electrodes on each pic and print
    to see if there are nearly 12
  - ...

General Notes:
----------------
- CT image: dense structures are brighter:
  - on preop pic: bone, fluid, air; white, gray, black
